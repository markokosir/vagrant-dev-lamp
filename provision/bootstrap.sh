xdebug.remote_enable=1
;;Type: boolean, Default value: 0
;;This switch controls whether Xdebug should try to contact a debug client which is listening on the host and port as set with the settings
;;xdebug.remote_host and xdebug.remote_port. If a connection can not be established the script will just continue as if this setting was 0.
"

"
;;xdebug.remote_host=127.0.0.1
;;Type: string, Default value: localhost
;;Selects the host where the debug client is running, you can either use a host name or an IP address. This setting is ignored if
;;xdebug.remote_connect_back is enabled.
"

"
xdebug.remote_connect_back=1
;;Type: boolean, Default value: 0, Introduced in Xdebug 2.1
;;If enabled, the xdebug.remote_host setting is ignored and Xdebug will try to connect to the client that made the HTTP request. It checks the
;;\$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] variable to find out which IP address to use. Please note that there is no filter available, and anybody who can connect to
;;the webserver will then be able to start a debugging session, even if their address does not match xdebug.remote_host.
"

"
;;xdebug.remote_port=9000
;;Type: integer, Default value: 9000
;;The port to which Xdebug tries to connect on the remote host. Port 9000 is the default for both the client and the bundled debugclient. As many
;;clients use this port number, it is best to leave this setting unchanged.
"

"
;;xdebug.remote_handler=dbgp
;;Type: string, Default value: dbgp
;;Can be either 'php3' which selects the old PHP 3 style debugger output, 'gdb' which enables the GDB like debugger interface or 'dbgp' - the
;;debugger protocol. The DBGp protocol is more widely supported by clients. See more information in the introduction for Remote Debugging.
;;Note: Xdebug 2.1 and later only support 'dbgp' as protocol.
"

"
;;xdebug.remote_mode=req
;;Type: string, Default value: req
;;Selects when a debug connection is initiated. This setting can have two different values:
;;req Xdebug will try to connect to the debug client as soon as the script starts.
;;jit Xdebug will only try to connect to the debug client as soon as an error condition occurs.
"

"
xdebug.idekey=vagrant
;;Type: string, Default value: *complex*
;;Controls which IDE Key Xdebug should pass on to the DBGp debugger handler. The default is based on environment settings. First the environment
;;setting DBGP_IDEKEY is consulted, then USER and as last USERNAME. The default is set to the first environment variable that is found. If none could
;;be found the setting has as default ''. If this setting is set, it always overrides the environment variables.
"

"
xdebug.remote_autostart=true
;;Type: boolean, Default value: 0
;;Normally you need to use a specific HTTP GET/POST variable to start remote debugging (see Remote Debugging). When this setting is set to 1, Xdebug
;;will always attempt to start a remote debugging session and try to connect to a client, even if the GET/POST/COOKIE variable was not present.
"

"
;;xdebug.remote_log=/tmp/xdebug.log
;;Type: string, Default value:
;;If set to a value, it is used as filename to a file to which all remote debugger communications are logged. The file is always opened in
;;append-;;mode, and will therefore not be overwritten by default. There is no concurrency protection available.
